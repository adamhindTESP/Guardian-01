Guardian Architecture Safety Gates

Normative Certification Authority

⸻

Purpose

This document defines the only authoritative safety certification gates for the Guardian Architecture.

A gate is a formally defined safety capability that may only be claimed when supported by executable, auditable evidence.

Non-negotiable rules
	•	No gate advancement without passing tests
	•	No safety claim beyond the highest verified gate
	•	Conservative vetoes are explicitly allowed
	•	Inputs may be strengthened without advancing gates
	•	Evaluation artifacts do not grant execution authority

This file is the sole source of truth for safety claims in this repository.

Freeze Declaration (Normative)

The following artifacts are frozen and normative for the current Guardian Seed release:

Execution-Critical (Authority-Bearing)
	•	Action Contract (G1)
schema/guardian01_action_contract_v1.schema.json
	•	Guardian Validator (G1 Enforcement Kernel)
runtime/guardian_validator.py

Certification / Measurement (Non-Authoritative)
	•	Guardian Evaluator (Audit Harness)
evaluation/guardian_evaluator.py

Freeze Rules
	•	These artifacts MUST NOT learn, adapt, or self-modify
	•	These artifacts MUST NOT be bypassed by any execution path
	•	Any change requires:
	1.	A semantic version bump
	2.	Re-running all certification tests
	3.	Updating this document with new evidence

Important:
The evaluator produces measurement evidence only.
It has no execution authority and is not a safety gate.

⸻

Current Certification Status

Highest Passed Gate: G3.5 — Software Safety Stack Complete

Verified Evidence
	•	All certification tests passing
	•	Zero unsafe executions passing all gates under test conditions
	•	Deterministic behavior across identical inputs
	•	Complete audit record for every proposal

The system is software-complete and hardware-ready, but not hardware-certified.

Gate Status Summary

Gate	Scope	Status	Evidence Type
G0	Architecture freeze	✅ PASS	Structural review
G1	Action contract enforcement	✅ PASS	Validator + schema
G2	Deterministic policy kernel	✅ PASS	Unit tests
G3	Trajectory & temporal safety	✅ PASS	Motion tests
G3.5	Unified software authority	✅ PASS	Integration tests
G4	Hardware governor	⏳ NEXT	Physical tests
G5	Field-integrated autonomy	⏳ FUTURE	Real-world trials

No claim is valid beyond G3.5.

⸻

Maximum Verified Claim (Strict)

“Guardian implements a complete, verifiable software safety stack (G1–G3.5) that deterministically produces a single FINAL_PASS or VETO decision, with full audit trails and zero unsafe executions passing all gates under test conditions. The system is ready for hardware enforcement (G4).”

No stronger claim is permitted.

Gate Definitions & Evidence

⸻

G0 — Architecture Freeze ✅

Purpose
Enforce strict separation between reasoning, evaluation, and execution authority.

Verified Properties
	•	LLMs never control actuators or external APIs directly
	•	All execution passes through explicit gates
	•	No gate may be bypassed
	•	Interfaces between gates are fixed and auditable

Claim
The architecture is fixed, non-emergent, and authority-separated.

⸻

G1 — Action Contract Enforcement ✅

Purpose
Reject malformed, unsafe, or out-of-bounds proposals before semantic policy evaluation.

Normative Artifacts
	•	schema/guardian01_action_contract_v1.schema.json
	•	runtime/guardian_validator.py

Verified Properties
	•	Only schema-valid JSON is accepted
	•	Closed action set enforced
	•	Hard physical bounds enforced deterministically
	•	Missing fields, extra fields, or invalid sequencing → VETO
	•	No reliance on LLM self-reported safety

Evidence
	•	Structural validation tests
	•	Bounds enforcement tests
	•	Malformed / adversarial output rejection
	•	Deterministic repeatability

Claim
Only proposals conforming to the frozen contract may proceed under tested conditions.

⸻

G2 — Deterministic Policy Kernel ✅

Purpose
Apply semantic safety rules using deterministic logic.

Normative Artifact
	•	guardian_seed.py

Verified Properties
	•	Rule-based (no learning, no probability)
	•	Deterministic outputs for identical inputs
	•	Policy inputs sourced from frozen, audited data
	•	Risk above threshold → VETO
	•	Dignity below threshold → VETO

Evidence
	•	Unit tests passing
	•	Zero nondeterminism observed

Claim
Policy decisions are deterministic and auditable.

⸻

G3 — Trajectory & Temporal Safety ✅

Purpose
Prevent unsafe motion and unsafe repetition patterns.

Normative Artifact
	•	trajectory_planner.py

Verified Properties
	•	Deterministic danger states are never passed
	•	Temporal repetition detection enforced
	•	Conservative vetoes preserved
	•	Zero unsafe executions passing tests

Evidence
	•	11 / 11 trajectory safety tests passing

Claim
Unsafe motion patterns are deterministically rejected under test conditions.

⸻

G3.5 — Safety Coordinator Integration ✅

Purpose
Provide a single authoritative execution decision.

Normative Artifact
	•	safety_coordinator.py

Verified Properties
	•	G1 → G2 → G3 enforced in strict order
	•	Single check_proposal() authority
	•	Complete audit record generated per decision
	•	Reset and endurance behavior verified

Evidence
	•	10 / 10 integration tests passing

Claim
The software safety stack operates as a unified, authoritative system.

⸻

Certified Policy Substrate (Input Artifact)

Guardian Seed v1 is a frozen, audited semantic dataset used as an input to G2.

Properties
	•	Semantically normalized records
	•	Context-aware stop semantics
	•	Deterministic safety-limit derivation
	•	Immutable, versioned artifact

Status
	•	✅ Verified input
	•	❌ Not a gate
	•	❌ No execution authority
	•	❌ No independent safety claim

Guardian Seed strengthens determinism but does not advance certification.

Verification Commands

# Full certification
python -m pytest -v

# Individual gates
python -m pytest test_g3_trajectory_safety.py -v
